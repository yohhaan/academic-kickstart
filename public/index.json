There are several reasons to switch to Firefox:\n Better CPU and RAM management Open source project Privacy is one of the centerpieces of Mozilla\u0026rsquo;s products Not owned by Google \u0026hellip;  Firefox Privacy \u0026amp; Security Settings Configure the privacy and security settings of Firefox, below are mine:\n Block cookies, tracking content, cryptominers, and fingerprinters in all windows Always send a Do not track signal to websites  Firefox Extensions Here are some very useful add-ons to protect you online:\nFacebook Container This extension prevents Facebook from tracking you around the web. It literally isolates Facebook in a separate container (in a blue tab) so that it makes it harder for Facebook to track the rest of your web activity on other websites with third-party cookies.\nFirefox Multi-Account Containers Similar to the previous extension, this extension allows you to create as many containers as you want to isolate your web activity and preserve your privacy: cookies are separated by container allowing you to use the web with multiple identities or accounts simultaneously.\nFor instance you can create containers to isolate your activity on your bank website, from your activity on streaming websites, on Google services\u0026hellip; When you create a new container, open the corresponding website(s) that you want to isolate and click on Always open in this container to automatically isolating it in this specific container.\nNoScript Security Suite This extension will protect you by only allowing the execution of JavaScript, Flash, and other executable contents on trusted domains. Those executable contents are used to exploit security vulnerabilities, by blocking them by default and allowing them only on the websites you trust, your web navigation is safer. At the very beginning after the installation of this extension, it is a little pricey to configure manually all your trusted domains as you visit them, but but it\u0026rsquo;s definitely worth it.\nuBlock Origin uBlock Origin is a content blocker that will block ads, tracking domains, malware domains\u0026hellip;\nSearch Engine For the search engine, you should also consider switching to something else than Google, DuckDuckGo is a good alternative.\nFirefox for Mobile You should also use Firefox on your mobile devices with DuckDuckGo. Some of the add-ons presented previously (especially NoScript and uBlock Origin) are also available on the mobile version.\n","date":1592064746,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1592064746,"objectID":"9a2de648effcfa2fed770c8bea6868c0","permalink":"https://yohhaan.github.io/posts/protect-your-privacy-online-firefox/","publishdate":"2020-06-13T12:12:26-04:00","relpermalink":"/posts/protect-your-privacy-online-firefox/","section":"posts","summary":"A series of posts to help you take back control of your privacy","tags":["privacy","firefox","browser","tracking"],"title":"Protect Your Privacy Online!

The Privacy Project an interesting -and scary- series from The New York Times Opinion about Privacy  One Nation, Tracked  It\u0026rsquo;s Time to Panic About Privacy  I Visited 47 Sites. Hundreds of Trackers Followed Me.  Use common sense This is perhaps the most important and simple advice: exercise common sense while browsing online! wherever something looks suspect, strange, or you are not sure about, think twice before clicking or entering all your information. Paying a bit more attention could save you big!\nBe careful with the information you provide online Make your social media accounts private if possible, do not share too many information. Let\u0026rsquo;s take a simple example: you are on holidays and you share your pictures online, if your friends will probably think that your pictures are wonderful, a malicious actor will obtain the information that you are not at home and could use it to break in\u0026hellip;\nSpam and scams You should never consider that an email is secure, nor trust a link sent into an email: pay attention to scams and spams, they can be very elaborate. If you have any doubt, do not click on the provided link, open a new tab and search for the information by visiting the website that is supposed to have sent you the email.\nPrivate Mode do not make you anonymous It just prevents your browser from locally saving cookies and other data, but the websites you are visiting have still access to your IP address\u0026hellip;\nUse a VPN to browse anonymously A VPN allows you to establish a secure and encrypted tunnel between your device and a server of your VPN provider. Thus, when the VPN connection is established, your IP is hidden and the websites you visit see another IP address provided by your VPN provider. This prevents websites from tracking your actual IP address and location, and from establishing your browsing habits.\nA VPN is the best way to protect your privacy online and browse anonymously. Choosing a VPN provider is not an easy task, as there are several things to take into account acording to your needs, but perhaps the most important point to remember is that you have to pick a VPN with a no-log policy, meaning that they do not track, collect, or share your activity. Obviously to obtain such privacy guarantees you will have to pay for your VPN, do not use a free VPN as it will probaby put your security at risk.\nOne of the leaders in the industry is NordPVN, they have undergone an audit from independent auditors to confirm their no-log policy, they are based out of the EU and the US, and they allow you to connect 6 devices at the same time. Surfshark is another promising alternative, however they have not undergone a complete independent audit of their services yet.\nAvoid using public Wifi hotspots Do not consider public Wifi hotspots as safe. In the same vein, do not recharge your devices at public USB stations.\nUse a password manager See my related post: You Shall Not Pass! (Password Management)\nTake the time to configure your accounts Configure your privacy settings on your accounts: Facebook, Google\u0026hellip; and opt out from any tracking and recording of your activity.\nDisable GPS localisation and Wi-Fi until you need them Do not facilitate the job of the trackers\u0026hellip;\nDo not use your social media accounts to log in on other websites Again here, the objective is to reduce the amount of data that is collected on you by those social medias.\nDo not perform Google searches while being connected to your Google account Same reason as the previous one: reduce the information collected by Google on you.\nLog out from websites after your visit If you do not need anymore to be logged in, you should log out before closing the tab.\nUse Firefox with some useful extensions and switch to another search engine than Google Search See this post Protect Your Privacy Online!

Have I Been Pwned? is a website that allows you to search over known data breaches and check if one or several of your accounts and personal information have been compromised. If so, you will see which personal information has been leaked and obtain details about the breach. The Notify me service allows you to be notified if your email address appears in future breaches.\nIf some of your accounts have been compromised, you should change your password, as well as all the other accounts that were using the same or a similar password, so that the malicious actors will not be able to break into your other accounts. If you were not already caught in a breach, do not think that you are safe: this is mostly a matter of time before having one of your account compromised.\nSo what should I do? First, you have to accept that at some point your passwords will be stolen. When this happens, the best way to protect yourself will be to have used long, unpredictable, and unique passwords for each of your account.\nObviously, it is impossible for us to remember tens of different, complex, and 30-character long passwords, and that\u0026rsquo;s where the password manager comes in.\nA password manager can be seen as a password safe where you safely store all your unique and complex passwords for all your accounts. And you only have to remember one unique and complex password which is used to unlock the database of passwords.\nThey are very simple to use, cross platforms (you can synchronize and have access to all your passwords from all your devices), they come with convenient browser extensions to log you in automatically on websites, and they will take care of randomly generating complex passwords for you.\nWhich password manager to use? I recommend you to use LastPass, because it is easy to configure, synchronize, and use accross all your devices. There are other options like 1Password and for more advanced users I would recommend to take a look at Keepass or at pass.\nYou will need to create a strong master password which will be the one that will allow you to unlock your vault of passwords. Create a unique and complex master password (do not use one that you were previously using\u0026hellip;), and remember it, otherwise you will loose access to all your other passwords\u0026hellip;\nThen you will have to add into your passwords vault, all your accounts and passwords. When you do so the first time, for each account:\n Log in to your account on this website with your old password Use your password manager to generate a long, complex, and unique password for this account Copy paste this password on the website in your account settings to change your old password for a random one  This might take you some time to do it for all your accounts the first time, but it\u0026rsquo;s definitely worth it.\nAdditional tips:\n Consider using multifactor authentication to add a second login step before being able to unlock your passwords vault. Do not be always sign in by default in the browser extension of your password manager: if someone else is using your device, she might have access to your passwords\u0026hellip;  For more advanced users, I would recommend to take a look at Keepass or at pass.\n","date":1592000255,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1592000255,"objectID":"e886636688262e4b64f4f2ae6a2e2ef6","permalink":"https://yohhaan.github.io/posts/you-shall-not-pass/","publishdate":"2020-06-12T18:17:35-04:00","relpermalink":"/posts/you-shall-not-pass/","section":"posts","summary":"In this post, I hope to convince you once for all to stop reusing this same exact password you use for all your accounts and start using a password manager.","tags":["security","password manager"],"title":"You Shall Not Pass!

ReViVD's novelty lies in using simple 3D shapes-such as cuboids, spheres and cylinders-as queries for users to select and filter groups of trajectories. Building on this simple paradigm, more complex queries can be created by combining previously made selection groups through a system of user-created Boolean operations. We demonstrate the use of ReViVD in different application domains, from GPS position tracking to simulated data (e. g., turbulent particle flows and traffic simulation). Our results show the ease of use and expressiveness of the 3D geometric shapes in a broad range of exploratory tasks. Re- ViVD was found to be particularly useful for progressively refining selections to isolate outlying behaviors. It also acts as a powerful communication tool for conveying the structure of normally abstract datasets to an audience.","tags":["Visualization toolkits;Virtual Reality;Trajectory-based datasets;3D geometric shapes;Human computer interaction (HCI);Interaction paradigms;Visualization systems and tools"],"title":"ReViVD: Exploration and Filtering of Trajectories in an Immersive Environment using 3D Shapes","type":"publication"}]
