## Interesting links
Let's start with some links: 
* [All the Ways Google Tracks You—And How to Stop It](https://www.wired.com/story/google-tracks-you-privacy/)
* Review your [Google Activity](https://myactivity.google.com/myactivity/), your [Timeline and Location History](https://www.google.com/maps/timeline), and [see the content that Google has on you](https://takeout.google.com/)

## Do not use your Google Account to sign in on other websites
Only use your Google Account for the Google related services and but not other websites to reduce the amount of data collected on you.

## Do not perform Google searches while being connected to your Google account
For the same reason as the previous one.

## Use Firefox instead of Google Chrome and another search engine than Google
Use the [Firefox Browser](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/), consider switching to another search engine than Google, and isolate Google Services into a specific [Firefox Multi-Account Container](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/). See my posts on Firefox for more details: [Protect Your Privacy Online! (Firefox Browser)](/posts/protect-your-privacy-online-firefox/).

## Configure your Google Account
Review thoroughly your [settings](https://myaccount.google.com), opt out of everything you can:
* *Personal info:* consider sharing as less personal information as you can, navigate to *Go to About me* and reduce who can see your information to **Only you** wherever possible
* *Data & personalization:* Manage your *Activity controls*, basically here juste delete all your activity (web activity, timeline, and location history), pause and opt out from any further recording, turn off *Ad personalization*
* *Take the Privacy Checkup* to check that you did not forget to opt out from something as the Google settings are like a maze to navigate through...
* Visit your *Google Dashboard* and take the time to visit each Google service you are using to configure it, delete uploaded data you are not using anymore...
* *Security:*  Log out from unactive sessions, use a strong and unique password (see [You Shall Not Pass! (Password Management)](/posts/you-shall-not-pass)), you can also from there manage *Signing in to other sites* if you used this option before
* *People & sharing:* Turn off contact information retrieval from interactions and from your devices as well as endorsements in ads
