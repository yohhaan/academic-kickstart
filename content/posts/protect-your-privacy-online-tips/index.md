## Why does it matter? 
* [The Privacy Project](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/opinion/internet-privacy-project.html) an interesting -and scary- series from The New York Times Opinion about Privacy
* [One Nation, Tracked](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/12/19/opinion/location-tracking-cell-phone.html)
* [It's Time to Panic About Privacy](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/04/10/opinion/internet-data-privacy.html)

## Use common sense

This is perhaps the most important and simple advice: exercise common sense while browsing online!
wherever something looks suspect, strange, or you are not sure about, think twice before clicking or entering all your information. Paying a bit more attention could save you big!

## Be careful with the information you provide online

Make your social media accounts private if possible, do not share too many information. Let's take a simple example: you are on holidays and you share your pictures online, if your friends will probably think that your pictures are wonderful, a malicious actor will obtain the information that you are not at home and could use it to break in...

## Spam and scams
You should never consider that an email is secure, nor trust a link sent into an email: pay attention to scams and spams, they can be very elaborate. If you have any doubt, do not click on the provided link, open a new tab and search for the information by visiting the website that is supposed to have sent you the email. 

## Private Mode do not make you anonymous

It just prevents your browser from locally saving cookies and other data, but the websites you are visiting have still access to your IP address...

## Use a VPN to browse anonymously

A VPN allows you to establish a secure and encrypted tunnel between your device and a server of your VPN provider. Thus, when the VPN connection is established, your IP is hidden and the websites you visit see another IP address provided by your VPN provider. This prevents websites from tracking your actual IP address and location, and from establishing your browsing habits. 

A VPN is the best way to protect your privacy online and browse anonymously. 
Choosing a VPN provider is not an easy task, as there are several things to take into account acording to your needs, but perhaps the most important point to remember is that you have to pick a VPN with a no-log policy, meaning that they do not track, collect, or share your activity. Obviously to obtain such privacy guarantees you will have to pay for your VPN, do not use a free VPN as it will probaby put your security at risk.

One of the leaders in the industry is [NordPVN](https://nordvpn.com/), they have undergone an audit from independent auditors to confirm their no-log policy, they are based out of the EU and the US, and they allow you to connect 6 devices at the same time. [Surfshark](https://surfshark.com/) is another promising alternative, however they have not undergone a complete independent audit of their services yet. 

## Avoid using public Wifi hotspots

Do not consider public Wifi hotspots as safe. 
In the same vein, do not recharge your devices at public USB stations.

## Use a password manager

See my related post: [You Shall Not Pass! (Password Management)](/posts/you-shall-not-pass)

## Take the time to configure your accounts

Configure your privacy settings on your accounts: Facebook, Google... and opt out from any tracking and recording of your activity.

## Disable GPS localisation and Wi-Fi until you need them

Do not facilitate the job of the trackers...

## Do not use your social media accounts to log in on other websites

Again here, the objective is to reduce the amount of data that is collected on you by those social medias.

## Do not perform Google searches while being connected to your Google account

Same reason as the previous one: reduce the information collected by Google on you.

## Log out from websites after your visit

If you do not need anymore to be logged in, you should log out before closing the tab.

## Use Firefox with some useful extensions and switch to another search engine than Google Search
