## Switch to Firefox Browser

I strongly recommend you to exclusively use the [Firefox Browser](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/) if you are not using it yet.
There are several reasons to switch to Firefox:
* Better CPU and RAM management
* Open source project
* Privacy is one of the centerpieces of Mozilla's products
* Not owned by Google
* ...

## Firefox Privacy & Security Settings

Configure the privacy and security settings of Firefox, below are mine: 
* Block cookies, tracking content, cryptominers, and fingerprinters in all windows
* Always send a *Do not track* signal to websites

## Firefox Extensions

Here are some very useful add-ons to protect you online:

![Firefox Extensions](/img/firefox_addons.png)


### [Facebook Container](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/facebook-container/)
This extension prevents Facebook from tracking you around the web. It literally isolates Facebook in a separate container (in a blue tab) so that it makes it harder for Facebook to track the rest of your web activity on other websites with third-party cookies.

### [Firefox Multi-Account Containers](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/)
Similar to the previous extension, this extension allows you to create as many containers as you want to isolate your web activity and preserve your privacy: cookies are separated by container allowing you to use the web with multiple identities or accounts simultaneously.

For instance you can create containers to isolate your activity on your bank website, from your activity on streaming websites, on Google services... When you create a new container, open the corresponding website(s) that you want to isolate and click on *Always open in this container* to automatically isolating it in this specific container.

### [NoScript Security Suite](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/noscript/)
This extension will protect you by only allowing the execution of JavaScript, Flash, and other executable contents on trusted domains. Those executable contents are used to exploit security vulnerabilities, by blocking them by default and allowing them only on the websites you trust, your web navigation is safer. 
At the very beginning after the installation of this extension, it is a little pricey to configure manually all your trusted domains as you visit them, but but it's definitely worth it.

### [uBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/)
uBlock Origin is a content blocker that will block ads, tracking domains, malware domains...

## Search Engine

For the search engine, you should also consider switching to something else than Google, [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) is a good alternative.

## Firefox for Mobile

You should also use Firefox on your [mobile devices](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/mobile/) with [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/). Some of the add-ons presented previously (especially NoScript and uBlock Origin) are also available on the mobile version.
