[Signal](https://www.signal.org/) is an open source, encrypted, and cross platform messaging application, there exists an iOS and Android applications and a desktop version for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Discussions, audios, video calls, pictures, documents... shared on Signal are end to end encrypted, meaning that only you and your correspondent(s) have access on your smartphones/laptops to the decryption keys to see the content of the messages, this guarantees your privacy.

The application is free, open source, and has been peer reviewed: thus, the cryptographic protocols and algorithms used by Signal have been validated as safe and secure. The development of the application is exclusively funded by donations, Signal does not track you, nor sell your activity or data.

Signal is regularly considered as the most secure and privacy-centric messaging application ever made.

## But WhatsApp also uses end to end encryption no?

That's true, however WhatsApp is managed by Facebook, which primary goal is to make money by selling ads and targeting ads to specific users. Moreover, even if WhatsApp is using end to end encryption, there are still able to collect metadata about your discussions: telephone numbers, contacts, statistics about your discussions, who you speak to, IP addresses...

Although Signal does not have all those fancy features, stickers, and games, its simplicity comes with a very big advantage which is far more important than anything else: the respect of your privacy.
