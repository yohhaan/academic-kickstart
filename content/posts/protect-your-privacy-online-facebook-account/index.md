If you have read my previous posts, you might have already seen some but not all of the following tips. 

## Interesting links
Let's start with some links: 
* [Days Since Last Facebook Scandal](https://dayssincelastfacebookscandal.com/) tracks the scandals in which Facebook is and has been involved
* [What You Don’t Know About How Facebook Uses Your Data](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/11/technology/facebook-privacy-hearings.html), an article from The New York Times with an overview on how Facebook tracks its users as well as nonusers
* [Request a copy of the information that Facebook has on you](https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=your_facebook_information)

## Do not sign in on other websites with you social media account
There are several steps you can take to reduce the tracking that Facebook performs on you. 
First, do not use your Facebook account to log in on other websites, if you want to reduce the amount of data  collected on you. Similarly be aware that when you play to games or use other applications on Facebook, you are sharing your data with their developers.

## Use Firefox and the Facebook Container Extension
Use the [Firefox Browser](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/) with the [Facebook Container Extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/facebook-container/) to prevent Facebook from tracking you around the web. See my posts on Firefox for more details: [Protect Your Privacy Online! (Firefox Browser)](/posts/protect-your-privacy-online-firefox/). I would strongly recommend you to delete the Facebook application from your smartphone and to only access to it through Firefox with the Facebook Container Extension.

## Configure your Facebook settings
Review thoroughly your [settings](https://www.facebook.com/settings) if you have a Facebook account, opt out of everything you can, and reduce the visibility of your activity and posts to the minimum wherever possible:
* *General:* Consider using an alias and changing your username
* *Security and Login:* Log out from unactive sessions, use a strong and unique password (see [You Shall Not Pass! (Password Management)](/posts/you-shall-not-pass)), remove authorized logins devices
* *Your Facebook Information:* Request a copy of your information to realize what Facebook knows about you, go over your Activity Log to manage it, turn off Off-facebook Activity.
* *Privacy:* Reduce the visibility of your activity and posts to the minimum wherever possible, limit the audience of your past posts, reduce to only you who can look up with your email address or your phone number, disable search engines to link to your profile.
* *Location:* Do I really need to tell you to turn off Location History?...
* *Blocking:* Consider blocking apps you have been using in the past so that they can no longer obtain your information.
* *Face recognition:* Turn off face recognition.
* *Apps and websites / Instant Games / Business Integrations:* I strongly recommend you to stop using Facebook with other apps and websites, revoke all the previously granted access, remove all the apps, and turn off the possiblity to interact with apps and other websites.
* *Other tabs:* Reduce the scope of visibility to the minimum wherever possible
